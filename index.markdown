List of DevOps Principles as they are described in the book "The Phoenix Project".
They are written down here as a reminder for myself.
If you are interested, you should read the book to have a better understanding of them.

## DevOps Principles

The principles are three. 
Each of them subdivided into practical hints.

### Principle of Flow

1. Make you work visible
2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
3. Reduce batch size
4. Reduce number of handoff
5. Continually identify and elevate constrain
6. Eliminate hardships and waste in the value stream

### Principle of Feedback

- Working safely within complex systems
- See problems as they occur
- Swarm and solve problems to build new knowledge
- Keep pushing quality closer to the source
- Enable optimizing for downstream work centers

- Enabling organizational learning and a safety culture
- Institutionalize the improvement of daily work
- Transform local discoveries into global improvements
