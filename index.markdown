List of DevOps Principles as they are described in the book "The Phoenix Project".
They are written down here as a reminder for myself.
If you are interested, you should read the book to have a better understanding of them.
The principles are three. 
Each of them subdivided into practical hints.

### General Consideration

Let's consider three time events:
- a ticket is created
- work started
- work completed

In this scenario, the actual work is between *work started* and *work completed* and goes under the name of *Process time*.
From a customer point of view, this is not what they are experincing. 
Customers experience the *Lead Time* i.e. the time span between *a ticket is created* and *work completed*.
We often focus on optimizing the *Process Time*, however, by reducing *Lead Time* we can achieve fast flow and reduce the time work is waiting in queue.

### Principle of Flow

- Make you work visible
- Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
- Reduce batch size
- Reduce number of handoff
- Continually identify and elevate constrain
- Eliminate hardships and waste in the value stream

***
### Principle of Feedback

- Working safely within complex systems
- See problems as they occur
- Swarm and solve problems to build new knowledge
- Keep pushing quality closer to the source
- Enable optimizing for downstream work centers

***
### Principle of Continual Learning and Experimentation

- Enabling organizational learning and a safety culture
- Institutionalize the improvement of daily work
- Transform local discoveries into global improvements
- Inject resilience patterns into our daily work
- Leaders reinforce a learning culture
