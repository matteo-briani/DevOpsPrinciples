List of DevOps Principles as they are described in the book "The Phoenix Project".
They are written down here as a reminder for myself.
If you are interested, you should read the book to have a better understanding of them.

## DevOps Principles

The principles are three. 
Each of them subdivided into practical hints.

***
### Principle of Flow

- Make you work visible
- Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
- Reduce batch size
- Reduce number of handoff
- Continually identify and elevate constrain
- Eliminate hardships and waste in the value stream

***
### Principle of Feedback

- Working safely within complex systems
- See problems as they occur
- Swarm and solve problems to build new knowledge
- Keep pushing quality closer to the source
- Enable optimizing for downstream work centers

***
### Principle of Continual Learning and Experimentation

- Enabling organizational learning and a safety culture
- Institutionalize the improvement of daily work
- Transform local discoveries into global improvements
- Inject resilience patterns into our daily work
- Leaders reinforce a learning culture
