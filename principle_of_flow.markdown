## Principle of Flow

***
### Make you work visible

A very visual example is to organize the work in a Kanban board. 
In this way you can actually see the incoming work, the current work and what has been done.
This configuration helps to see the actual flow of work.

***
### Limit Work in Progress (WIP)

Limit work in progress to few tasks, ideally three. 
In this way bad multitasking is limited and it is easier to reason about the flow of work.
If we find out that limiting the WIP we have nothing to do, then it means we are depending on someone else.
Instead of catching new work, we should detect what is cause the delay.

***
### Reduce batch size

It was common to produce in large batch size but the result is long lead time and poor quality because when a problem is found, the entire batch is affected by it.
Instead, we should focus on smaller batch size.
This approach results in less WIP and faster lead time and detection of errors.

***
### Reduce number of handoff

Each time some work passes from team to team there is a lot of coordination involved.
Each step is a potential queue where work will wait.

***
### Continually identify and elevate constrain

In *Beyond the Goal* Dr. Goldratt stats: 
> In any value stream, there is always a direction of flow, and there is always one and only one constraint; any improvement not made at that constraint is an illusion

***
### Eliminate hardships and waste in the value stream

There are several categories of waste and hardship (from *Implementing Lean Software Development*)
   * Partially done work (PDW ages quickly and becomes obsolete)
   * Extra processes (Whatever does not add value, ex unused documentation, reviews or approvals that do not add value)
   * Extra features (Features that are not needed by the customer)
   * Task switching (Context switch requires time)
   * Waiting (self explanatory)
   * Motion (Whatever requires some motion. Ex handsoff are motion waste, or people that need to communicate frequently but they are not colocated)
   * Defects (Incorrect, missing or unclear informations etc.)
   * Nonstandard or manual work (Ideally, any dependencies should be automated, self-serviced and alvailable on demand)
   * Heroics (When individuals or teams are required to perform unreasonable acts; ex. stay at work longer shifts)
